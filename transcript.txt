Speaker 1 (Broker): Hey Bill, good to connect. Thanks for making time. I know things are crazy with the new opening.

Speaker 2 (Client): Yeah, hey Sarah. Sorry, it's loud here. We're testing the sound system. Can you hear me?

Speaker 1: Loud and clear. So, let's get into it. I want to get this quote turned around for "The Rusty Anchor" before the weekend. Are we still using the 123 Harbor Blvd address?

Speaker 2: No, that was the old office. The actual tavern is at 450 Maple Avenue, in Charleston, South Carolina. Zip is 29401.

Speaker 1: Got it. 450 Maple. And you're fully owning the building or leasing?

Speaker 2: Leasing. The landlord is a pain, actually.

Speaker 1: Okay, noted. Let's talk revenue. What are you projecting for year one gross sales?

Speaker 2: Conservative estimate? Probably $850,000. My brother thinks we’ll hit a million, but let's stick with 850k for the paperwork.

Speaker 1: Smart. And what’s the split? How much of that is alcohol vs food?

Speaker 2: It's heavy on the booze. I'd say 70% liquor, 30% food. We're doing high-end cocktails.

Speaker 1: 70/30, got it. Any live entertainment? That changes the risk profile significantly.

Speaker 2: Just a piano player on weekends. No bands, no mosh pits. Oh, and by the way, I used to be with Geico for my personal stuff, but for this business policy, I want something specialized.

Speaker 1: Understood. We won't use a generalist. Last thing—when do you need this bound by?

Speaker 2: ASAP. But listen, don't call me tomorrow morning. I'm taking my daughter to her dentist appointment. I won't be free until after 1:00 PM on Tuesday.

Speaker 1: Perfect. I'll reach out Tuesday afternoon. Talk soon, Bill.
